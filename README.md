Vehicle Fuel Pump Manufacturer - Machine Downtime Minimization Project

Client Overview

Client: Leading vehicle fuel pump manufacturer

Product: Fuel pumps used to take fuel as input and push fuel as output at high velocity
Business Problem
Issue: Unplanned machine downtime in pump manufacturing process
Impact: Loss of productivity, affecting production schedules and delivery timelines

Business Objective
Objective: Minimize unplanned machine downtime
Goal: Ensure smooth operation of pump manufacturing machines to maintain productivity levels and meet production targets
Business Constraint

Balance: Optimize maintenance activities to reduce downtime while controlling costs
Project Overview

Approach: Utilize data analytics and predictive maintenance techniques to minimize unplanned machine downtime
Strategy: Implement proactive maintenance schedules based on machine health indicators and predictive analytics
Methodology
Data Collection: Gather historical data on machine performance, maintenance records, downtime incidents, and relevant operational parameters.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to remove noise, handle missing values, and format it for analysis.

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the data to build predictive models, such as machine usage patterns, operating conditions, and maintenance history.

Predictive Modeling: Develop machine learning models to predict potential machine failures or downtime events based on historical data and identified patterns.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the predictive models using appropriate evaluation metrics and validate their accuracy in predicting downtime events.

Implementation: Integrate the predictive maintenance system into the manufacturing process to enable proactive maintenance scheduling and minimize unplanned downtime.
